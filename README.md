# Billboard_Hit

This repository consists of the python code (as ipynb notebooks) and the pickle of different trained models. 

The pickles can be loaded and used to carry out predictions.

The models used were:
-	Logistic Regression (LR)
-	Decision Tree (DT)
-	Random Forest (RF)
-	K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
-	Gaussian Na√Øive Bayes (GNB)
-	Perceptron
-	Bagging DT
-	Gradient Boosting DT (GBDT)
-	SVM
-	Neural Network

We have provided npy files for the 2 different transformations of the data set:
1. MinMax Scaled version
2. Standard Scalar version
3. Original dataset
